# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burned42/npradio/master/public/favicon-32x32.png) Now Playing Radio

NPRadio is a webpage that collects information from different radio stations
and displays the current playing songs, if there is a moderator online and
how the show is named etc. and offers the possibility to play these streams
directly in your browser.

A Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/burned42/npradio).
