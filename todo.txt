think about how to design the app
will it be a server / client thing?
-> server fetches data about streams regularly
-> multiple clients can ask about data at any time and get an instant response

or will it be only on the client side?
-> server responds with js which then will fetch data itself from the stream
homepages
-> stream sites will get called multiple times
-> clients (especially mobile) would not want to call e.g. rm.fm every 10s

should be a server/client thing I think

on client side it should use js obviously

server side? also js?

on second thought, I think I should start with a server only concept where the
server fetches the data on request and responds with the complete data ...
lets see if this performs well enough
